			<title>Cookie Clicker using UiPath</title>
			<link>http://blog.roman015.com/posts/post_008.html</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Tried giving &lt;a href="uipath.com"&gt;UiPath&lt;/a&gt; a shot, and while going through the tutorials and documentation I thought to myself, "Hey, this is perfect for that &lt;a href="https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/"&gt;Cookie Clicker Game&lt;/a&gt;!".&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tried giving &lt;a href="uipath.com"&gt;UiPath&lt;/a&gt; a shot, and while going through the tutorials and documentation I thought to myself, &amp;quot;Hey, this is perfect for that &lt;a href="https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/"&gt;Cookie Clicker Game&lt;/a&gt;!&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, I proudly present - &lt;a href="https://github.com/roman015/CookieClickerUiPath"&gt;Cookie Clicker&lt;/a&gt; Played in UiPath!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still going through this but I gotta say, UiPath is really easy to pick up! If you can figure out the nuances of dragging and dropping instead of traditional coding and typing and once you get the hang of the syntax for &lt;a href="https://docs.uipath.com/studio/docs/about-selectors"&gt;Selectors&lt;/a&gt;, it's a piece of cake!&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Timezone Tool</title>
			<link>http://blog.roman015.com/posts/post_007.html</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This time it's a simple tool to view the same time across multiple timezones. Add as many clocks as desired, and if you change the time on any of the clocks the others will change to show the exact same time on the time zone selected above it. I'll be adding the daylight savings feature sometime later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I'll be adding the daylight savings feature sometime later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made this mainly to try out the &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/cascading-values-and-parameters?view=aspnetcore-5.0"&gt;Parameters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/event-handling?view=aspnetcore-5.0#eventcallback"&gt;EventCallback&lt;/a&gt;features that can be tacked on to components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Timezone tool can be viewed over &lt;a href="https://www.roman015.com/TimezoneTool"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting thing I found out while making this was how many timezones there are. Boy there's a lot of them! For now, I just used the Canonical (I hope that's enough!) list of items from Wikipedia's entry for the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones"&gt;tz database&lt;/a&gt; for the dropdown.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>A New Website!</title>
			<link>http://blog.roman015.com/posts/post_006.html</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/dotnet-five"&gt;.Net5.0&lt;/a&gt; came out sometime back and I figured it's time to do some remodelling! And so the website's architechture is now completly changed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/dotnet-five"&gt;.Net5.0&lt;/a&gt; came out sometime back and I figured it's time to do some remodelling! And so the website's architechture is now completly changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously it was completely built on .Net Core and was running on a single Droplet in Digital Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it's running on the Digital Ocean Apps Platform in three pieces -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Static Site for &lt;a href="http://www.roman015.com"&gt;www.roman015.com&lt;/a&gt;. This one is done in .Net5 webassembly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Static Site for blog.roman015.com. This one is still using wyam.io&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The APIs will be hosted in api.roman015.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the main benefit of running it on the Apps Platform is that there's potential for scalability (not that I'll actually need it, but it's good to know there's a backup plan)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code for these three can be found in different branches in &lt;a href="https://github.com/roman015/roman015.com"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;. You can even find the source code for the old version in the 2.0 Branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things I'll need to do is to consider updating the static site generator for the blog and to add some extra documentation (I think I'll use the master branch for that from now on)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One extra thing I'd like to point out - QR Code generation in &lt;a href="http://www.roman015.com/QRCode"&gt;www.roman015.com/QRCode&lt;/a&gt; is now comletely client side and is no longer dependent on any server side execution, hurray!&lt;/p&gt;

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It's the &lt;a href="https://www.roman015.com/GuessTheNumber"&gt;Guess the Number Game&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty simple game to play - A number between 1 and 100 has been chosen, can you figure out what the chosen number is using the least number of guesses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just enter a number in the textbox to enter your guess. You can keep entering a number in the textbox to start the next game once you've guessed the number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now it's via the website &lt;a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/about"&gt;Buy Me A Coffee&lt;/a&gt;. Its only PayPal based at the moment, so you'll need a PayPal account for payments to go through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Coming up soon - &lt;a href="post_005.html"&gt;Guess the Number Game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Moving from Azure to DigitalOcean</title>
			<link>http://blog.roman015.com/posts/post_003.html</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've moved from Azure to DigitalOcean!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
			<guid>http://blog.roman015.com/posts/post_003.html</guid>
			<pubDate>Sat, 16 May 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I've moved from Azure to DigitalOcean!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well... I had some more interesting plans and spending 60 bucks on the next tier of hosting solutions on Azure isn't exactly my thing (or on my budget) - so from now on I'm hosting this site on DigitalOcean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Did anyone notice that the logo on the website is spelled as a single word? I just noticed that while typing out this blog" src="/assets/img/DO_Powered_by_Badge_blue.png" height="40px"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the source code is finally on GitHub too - you can see it over here at &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/roman015/roman015.com"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-120px-plus.png" height="20px" width="20px" title="Also, did anyone notice that GitHub is spelled with a capital H?"&gt;&lt;/img&gt; https://github.com/roman015/roman015.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the basic setup is like this now - Source code on Github is picked up by Circle CI which builds the code and deploys the .Net Core executables to the DigitalOcean Droplet. The Droplet consists of an nginx server which reverse proxys the http requests to the different .Net Core Applications (Currently there's only two of them, but there's more to come!)&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Setting up SSL</title>
			<link>http://blog.roman015.com/posts/post_002.html</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Got lots of plans for hosting a great website, but first things first - I need to let everyone into my site using HTTPS!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Got lots of plans for hosting a great website, but first things first - I need to let everyone into my site using HTTPS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic gist of my problem is that I don't have a huge budget, and the minimum plan that Azure has that suports SSL certificates costs.....above 50USD, which is waaay above my budget. Fortunately I found this : &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/how-to-get-your-ssl-for-free-on-shared/"&gt;https://www.troyhunt.com/how-to-get-your-ssl-for-free-on-shared/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic gist is - Cloudflare has a free tier with which it automatically creates and renews SSL certificates (and allows you to manage DNS records to your website). So once you create a Cloudflare account and sign up for the free plan, all you gotta do is....relax!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No kidding, Cloudflare just copies existing DNS records and SSL is just the free cherry on the top of all that! Now just to make sure that all my web apps on Azure are set to allow SSL by default.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Hello There!</title>
			<link>http://blog.roman015.com/posts/post_001.html</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Hello and welcome to the Missing Source Code! Currently I'm hosting this site as a bunch of static pages generated using &lt;a href="http://wyam.io"&gt;Wyam&lt;/a&gt; inside a .NET Core Project which hopefully will actually come in handy later on in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;As time passes I'll add more updates to this blog about the stack I'm using to host this site and other side projects that I hopefully will be able to finish sometime.&lt;/p&gt;
